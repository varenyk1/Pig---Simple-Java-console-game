# Pig---Simple-Java-console-game
(December 2021) A simple game I made for the Java console in 10th grade.
Wanted to upload it now because a few of my friends were struggling with Java now (12th grade) and this makes a decent guide in my opinion. :)

(Not an up-to-date example of my current work. lol)


How to play: just run this game in a Java console, I made this on the website 'repl.it' in class but using repl.it is not required for it to work, it worked just fine-
when I ran did a quick test run on my computer at home.
